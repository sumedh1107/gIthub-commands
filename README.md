now you have a project on local machine with vscode and want to push it on github <br>
//this creates an empty local repo<br>
git init <br><br>


//i got Author identity unknown therefore <br>
git config --global user.email "sumeghd@gmail.com" <br>
git config user.email "sumeghd@gmail.com" <br>
git config --local -l<br>
<br>
//stage all the changes <br><br><br><br>
// This means that git knows about the change, but it is not permanent in the repository. The next commit will include the changes staged.<br> 
git add . //. means include all files "git add hello.html" is also valid<br><br>
//The third icon from the left “+” will stage the changes. You will not be able to commit to you local repository without staging your changes.<br><br>

//A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record <br>//changes in small commits.<br><br>
