now you have a project on local machine with vscode and want to push it on github 
//this creates an empty local repo
git init 


//i got Author identity unknown therefore
git config --global user.email "sumeghd@gmail.com"
git config user.email "sumeghd@gmail.com"
git config --local -l

//stage all the changes 
// This means that git knows about the change, but it is not permanent in the repository. The next commit will include the changes staged.
git add . //. means include all files "git add hello.html" is also valid
//The third icon from the left “+” will stage the changes. You will not be able to commit to you local repository without staging your changes.

//A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record //changes in small commits.
